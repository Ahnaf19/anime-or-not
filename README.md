# anime-or-not
Anime-Or-Not (AoN) is an API that exposes prediction endpoint of an deep learning leveraged image classifier, detecting if its either anime or cartoon.

## Project Overview

Although Anime and Cartoon both are a form of animation and look almost the same, there are some structural differences between the two that can be exploited to classify them.

**Create an image classification API that leverages a deep learning model to classify images as either anime or cartoon. The API will expose a prediction endpoint to take an image as input and return a classification label.**

> Being developed on: python 3.10.16
